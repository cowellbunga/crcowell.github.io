These plants are more likely thrive when unique conditions such as acidic, moist soils and the existence of small-scale wildfires overlap in space. Unfortunately, the species falls victim to poaching and habitat change - this may be the reason for ongoing efforts to have the plant listed as threatened or endangered. Researchers and citizen scientists alike stand to benefit from the ground-truthing of habitat extents and the generation of new observations. A custom ArcGIS Toolbox has been developed to enable basic habitat suitability analysis, as well as the comparison of suitable areas, or \"hotspots\", to locations of recent recorded sightings. Analysis Figure 1. ArcTools user interface for the hotspot analysis Figure 2. ArcTools user interface for the site selection To support education and research efforts related to flytrap conservation, a geospatial application was developed. This application takes multiple environmental parameters that are clipped to the study extent (North Carolina) and filtered according to optimal Venus flytrap (D. muscipula) habitat conditions. These parameters are constrained and overlaid to produce a \u201chotspots\u201d layer which indicates areas where there may be more favorable conditions for Venus flytrap populations. The program compares these hotspots with recent, research-grade public observation data in an attempt to establish potential field study zones where the species may be thriving. The process produces user-defined, mile-distance buffers around each observation point to determine the level of overlap between hotspots and documented populations. The total overlap of hotspots within each respective buffer distance is also summarized in a message. The process also outputs a user-defined web page presenting observation points that directly overlap (or using buffers if no direct overlap) with the \u201chotspots\u201d layer. This web page presents study sites that should be prioritized for near-term field research on known populations (ex: ground-truthing). This summary data acts as a starting point for exploratory researchers seeking to produce more observation data in areas where thriving populations have not yet been recorded. Results Figure 3. Example output maps of flytrap observations and habitats Figure 3 shows an example output map that provides an visual overview of flytrap observations and their proximity to expected habitat sites. The hotspot zones represent areas where users should search for venus flytraps. The tool is designed this way to encourage users to produce more observations via iNaturalist. Reflection This custom tool allows users to visually explore the relationship between community flytrap observations and locations that expected to be flytrap hotspots. The custom inputs allow the user to focus on specific habitat characteristics over specific timeframes. This tool could be further improved by creating an automated request/update feature for updating the input iNaturalist data. Permanent Homestead Observation and Ranking Tool (PHORT) # Problem Description In recent years, the housing market has been extremely volatile across the US, with prices in the Triangle at sustained all-time highs. Natural and man-made resources are also becoming increasingly more strained in areas with higher population density. The higher demand for resources and shelter can also drive prices higher in suburban, peri-urban, and urban areas. It may be potentially more cost-effective to settle in a rural area where more land is typically available for purchase and the average cost per acre is generally lower. Another benefit that aligns with seeking rural land for a permanent home is that there are programs such as the USDA Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program. Due to these circumstances, I decided to seek rural land to build my own homestead, so that I can avoid purchasing an overvalued house with potentially unfavorable rates, and so that I may also take my household resource management into my own hands. To maximize the user's chances of receiving financial support from programs like the one from USDA, a spatially explicit methodology is used to evaluate tax parcels for their viability to support a rural homestead. The methodology has been packaged in the Python programming language and named the Permanent Homestead Observation and Ranking Tool (PHORT). Analysis Once the input datasets are available in the correct locations and formats, the tool can begin the analysis. There are logical checks throughout the process that check for the presence of the input data as well as the results of preprocessing, to prevent both failure and unnecessary processing. The process starts off by taking user preferences which are used to prepare the parcel data and togglable explanatory layers, such as elevation and distance to cropland. Figure 1 shows an example of the first stage of the process, where the user sets their preferences, and which are then passed to the preprocessing functions. Figure 1. Initial prompt to start process Figure 2. Python console progress report After the parcels are filtered according to user preferences, the tool prompts the user for additional preferences that influence how the final score is calculated. First the user determines whether they prefer higher or lower elevations, then the user confirms whether they prefer to be located closer or further from existing crop production. I currently opt for higher elevations and closer proximity to cropland \u2013 this seems to be a good proxy for avoiding flood zones while still given some favor to lower, flatter areas that farms typically exist in. The other layers are currently preprocessed arbitrarily, with their importance being implied. Public water supply, power lines, and major roads all lend to resource availability especially in cases where the potential for self-sufficiency is limited (ex: no wells to groundwater). The solar radiation and aspect surfaces are both processed to favor flat or Southfacing areas that have high solar photovoltaic potential. Results After all the input layers are preprocessed, the final score surface is calculated by multiplying all the raster surfaces together. This final surface represents the viability of a grid cell to support a self-sufficient homestead on a scale of 0 (no viability) to 1 (perfect viability). The scoring surface is then used in a zonal analysis where the average homestead score is calculated within each parcel based on the mean score of contained pixels. Figure 3. Map of NC with homestead score surface Figure 4. Sample of tax parcels with scores Figure 5. Legend for the homestead score Figure 4 shows an example tax parcel with its data shown, including the total count of pixels as well as the mean, median, minimum, and maximum scores within the parcel. Figure 5 represents the legend for the scores shown in Figure 4 . Reflection Creating this scenario allowed me to explore a potential use for custom spatial analyis, for the purpose of acquiring potentially resourceful land. While this analysis was applied to a fake scenario, the research performed for it has taught me about land assets and what to look for when purchasing them with self-sufficiency in mind. Ideally this tool could be improved by using field data on the relationship between successful homestead locations and hotspots from the tool. Additional or alternate variables could also be included in the scoring system to improve results.","title":"Modeling and Analytics"},{"location":"competencies/modeling/#assessment-of-venus-flytrap-sightings-and-habitat-suitability","text":"Problem Description The Venus flytrap, or Dionaea Muscipula, is a unique species of carnivorous flora that is endemic to the Carolinas, favoring moist, loamy and/or sandy soils that are often found among Longleaf pine forests.

(2019) # Problem Description Figure 1. Theuerkauf et al. 2019 thumbnail As an independent study topic, I took on the responsibility of learning and scripting the North Carolina oyster habitat suitability index (HSI) described in Theuerkauf et al. (2019) . I worked under the guidance of my project team that included Dr. David Eggleston and Dr. Del Bohnenstiehl from NC State, Dr. Brandon Puckett from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Bennett Paradis from the North Carolina Department of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF). The goals of this effort were to script and document the HSI process, HSI comparison, and HSI to oyster density comparison to expedite the process and allow for a more streamlined analysis. Analysis To establish a firm understanding of the concept and application, I reviewed the paper linked in the Problem Description, as well as two other relavant papers. The project team helped me learn the structure of observed oyster data and also helped me understand how the data related to the HSI by testing with updated data alongside historical data for comparison. The team also advised me on the which explanatory variables should or should not be considered. Figure 2. HSI readme document intro section Figure 3. HSI readme document variables section The exclusionary variables included: bathymetry, bottom type, shellfish leases, nursery areas, military zones, and navigational channels. The threshold variables included: salinity, larval import/export to different habitat types, dissolved oxygen, material stockpile sites, boat ramps, chlorophyll, and flow. A data inventory, a ReadMe/user guide (see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ), and a script were packaged to organize the data and analysis into a user-friendly Python environment. The script includes logic to calculate the HSI, but also includes logic to perform further assessments such as HSI to HSI comparisons and relating HSI to oyster density. The HSI calculation function within the tool includes two parameters that can be toggled to alter the scope of a specific HSI run: the model focus and the model type. The model can focus on either metapopulation persistence, water filtration, or both. The model type can be null (general), reproduction-based, or time-based. Results Figure 4. HSI and oyster density relationship The results of the process are served via the Python console outputs, output data sheets, and graphs produced by the scripts. The input variables are used by the script to produce HSI estimates that can be compared. The comparison function compares two sets of HSI results, which are the oldest and newest result files by default, but both datasets can be specified by the user. For example, the previous HSI run results shown in Figure 5 can be compared to the new results shown in Figure 6 . The script also automates the assessment of the relationship between HSI results and oyster density and an example output from that process is shown in Figure 4 . Figure 5. Map of previous HSI run Figure 6. Map of updated HSI run Reflection This project was a great opportunity to learn how spatial tools are developed and used for real-world applications. The project team seems eager to continue developing the tool further to become more data-driven and automated. I hope to continue working with them to make this a reality. It would be very fulfilling for me to assist in making improvements that would influence real-world decisions regarding our State\u2019s critical habitats and natural resources. Automating Output Visuals for Venus Flytrap observations using Python and HTML # Problem Description To streamline the process of producing some visual outputs for my Venus Flytrap project , I decided to create a script to automate the process. The project focuses on identifying the overlap between expected Venus flytrap habitats and field observations, to highlight areas where researchers should visit. Based on user inputs, contextual visuals need to be produced by the script to show research-grade iNaturalist observations being considered in the analysis. The goal of this effort was to produce a static web page showing flytrap observation images and details for all observations that meet the user-defined criteria. Analysis Figure 1. ArcTools user interface for static web page generation Figure 2. Python code used to generate static web pages The process is bundled in within an ArcGIS Toolbox (see Figure 1 ) to present the user with an easy-to-use graphical interface for setting their desired criteria. The primary criteria set by the user are the count of observations and cutoff year. These criteria filter the observations for the user's focus region and limits all outputs to the same scope. The script used for automating the static web page generation is shown below in Figure 2 . Results Figure 3. Example output web page of flytrap observations An example output static web page is shown in Figure 3 . The process leverages Python to automate the generation of custom html code that is defined by user criteria. Reflection This effort helped me learn how to automate the generation of HTML code using Python. This made it easy to integrate these steps with my existing processes. In the future, it would be nice expand on this by customizing style of the static pages.","title":"Programming"},{"location":"competencies/programming/#scripting-the-oyster-hsi-from-theuerkauf-et-al-2019","text":"Problem Description Figure 1. Theuerkauf et al. 2019 thumbnail As an independent study topic, I took on the responsibility of learning and scripting the North Carolina oyster habitat suitability index (HSI) described in Theuerkauf et al. (2019) . I worked under the guidance of my project team that included Dr. David Eggleston and Dr. Del Bohnenstiehl from NC State, Dr. Brandon Puckett from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Bennett Paradis from the North Carolina Department of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF). The goals of this effort were to script and document the HSI process, HSI comparison, and HSI to oyster density comparison to expedite the process and allow for a more streamlined analysis. Analysis To establish a firm understanding of the concept and application, I reviewed the paper linked in the Problem Description, as well as two other relavant papers. The project team helped me learn the structure of observed oyster data and also helped me understand how the data related to the HSI by testing with updated data alongside historical data for comparison. The team also advised me on the which explanatory variables should or should not be considered. Figure 2. HSI readme document intro section Figure 3. HSI readme document variables section The exclusionary variables included: bathymetry, bottom type, shellfish leases, nursery areas, military zones, and navigational channels. The threshold variables included: salinity, larval import/export to different habitat types, dissolved oxygen, material stockpile sites, boat ramps, chlorophyll, and flow. A data inventory, a ReadMe/user guide (see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ), and a script were packaged to organize the data and analysis into a user-friendly Python environment. The script includes logic to calculate the HSI, but also includes logic to perform further assessments such as HSI to HSI comparisons and relating HSI to oyster density.
